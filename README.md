# Basic-Caeser-Cipher-Encryption
This is a very basic ceaser cipher app written in javascript. 
To Run this there is 2 ways:

1. Create a html boilerplate and under the title add a script tag linking to the app.js
      ex. <script src="app.js"> 
2. Or getting node js installed on you local computer and then just open cmd at app.js and run (recommended)
      folder[app.js] > node app.js

What does it do:

This program basically just prompt users for input asks for 3 things 

1. Do you want to encrypt or decrypt
2. What keyShift do you want to use
3. What string do you want to encrypt or decrypt


After hitting enter it will output 

> encrypted string / decrypted string
